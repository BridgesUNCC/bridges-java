## Getting Started



### As a Student

### As a Developer

- Clone this repository
- Install [Gradle](http://gradle.org)
- Run ```gradle fatjar``` in your bridges directory.
- The resulting jar can be found in ```./build/libs/*.jar```

#### Dependency

You need a somewhat recent gradle. Version 4.4 is too old. Version 8.8 works.
